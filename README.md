Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge that:

Some of the code snippets, algorithms, and learning resources have been referenced from online tutorials and course material, particularly from the 100 Days of Code challenge.
Some of the images used in this repository, especially for certain visual projects and exercises, are not owned by me. These images were provided by the course itself as part of the learning resources.
A special thank you to all the creators, instructors, and the open-source community who made these resources available to help me grow as a developer.
